# Optimization of a Double Wishbone Suspension Geometry for Off-road Vehicles using Genetic Algorithm and Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project explores methods to predict wheel alignment angles and optimize double wishbone suspension geometry for off-road vehicles. Suspension three dimensional points are evaluated using a Genetic Algorithm for desirable values of toe, camber, kingpin and castor angles. A regression methodology is employed to accurately predict these angles at all values of the bump angle. For prime vehicle performance of an ATV in bumps and droops, all four angles must lie between their specific ranges. Genetic Algorithm incorporates these constraints to determine chromosome fitness, and generate better off springs. Selection, crossover, and mutation are operated on each generation of the populations to converge towards most ideal coordinates. This repository contains implementation for our work <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9852873">**Optimization of a Double Wishbone Suspension Geometry for Off-road Vehicles using Genetic Algorithm and Machine Learning**</a> published in <a href = "http://www.icmae.org">ICMAE 2022</a>.
